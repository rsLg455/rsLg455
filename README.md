- 👋 Hi, I’m @rsLg455 - this is my code name in the virtual world!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and everything related to IT. I started programming in Basic on a Commodore64 back in 1984 and played around with CP/M operating system at that time! Have work with PC starting with 286 Intel processor, and been programming in assembly language on microprocessors, and my first database was Dbase III! 
- Have also some years of experience in hardware and work as system administrator for one of the biggest organisation in Mauritius. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and Python! Both on a professional level and also on personal level! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C#, Python and data engineering/analysis!

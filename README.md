- 👋 Hi, I’m @rsLg455 - this is my code name in the virtual world!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and everything related to IT. I started programming in Basic on a Commodore64 back in 1984 and played around with CP/M operating system at that time! Have work with PC starting with 286 Intel processor, and used to programm in assembly language, PASCAL, and my first database experience was Dbase III! Then of course used a number of programming languages and databases DbaseIV, FoxPro, C..and eventually C++, Pro*C, SQLBase(Gupta Technologies), VB, VB.Net, ASP, Javascript...
- Have also some years of experience in hardware and work as system administrator for one of the biggest organisation in Mauritius. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and Python! Both on a professional level and also on personal level!
